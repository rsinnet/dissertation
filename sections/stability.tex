\chapter{\uppercase{Lyapunov Stability}}

This chapter discusses notions of stability in hybrid dynamical systems.
%
Because of the unique nature of hybrid systems, analysis of stability requires
special treatment which is distinct from continuous-time systems and more
closely parallels that used for discrete-time systems.
%
Contemporary notions of stability in nonlinear systems generally rely on results
initially presented in the doctoral work of Aleksandr Lyapunov in his doctoral
thesis in 1892 \cite{Lyapunov1992}.
%
In said treatise, Lyapunov described two methods for analyzing the stability of
equilibrium points of ordinary differential equations.

The {\em first method}, sometimes called the {\em indirect method of Lyapunov},
provides a means for understanding the stability properties of an equilibrium
point by examining a linearization of the nonlinear system.
%
Due to the nature of linearization, the results of such an analysis only pertain
locally and within an unknown region about the equilibrium point.
%
Nonetheless, this method is well-known and sees widespread use due to its
simplicity and straightforward nature.
%

The {\em second method}, sometimes called the {\em direct method of Lyapunov}
involves the use of scalar-valued functions of the state of a system called {\em
  Lyapunov functions} which satisfy specific conditions that are set forth
later.
%
Through the use of these Lyapunov functions, it is possible to prove
stability not only locally but in a known region containing an equilibrium point
or even globally.
%
These functions are not unique and a major drawback to this method is the lack
of an algorithmic procedure for constructing valid Lyapunov functions.

Both methods are used in this work but for different purposes:
%
Lyapunov's indirect method is often used to analyze the stability of hybrid
systems by considering examining the stability of a linearization of the
\Poincare{} map about the equilibrium point; this will be explained in greater
detail later in this chapter.
%
Accordingly, the numerical simulations in this work will rely on this usage of
Lyapunov's indirect method.
%
In order to formally demonstrate the stability of energy shaping---the main
focus of this work---Lyapunov's direct method will be employed.
%
This method is often used in theoretical proofs and can also be used to
understand domain of attraction, although the constructions used will preclude
this type of application.

Stability of systems has a long history and dates back even before the work of
Lyapunov, appearing in the works of researchers such as Routh \cite{Routh1877}
and Hurwitz \cite{Hurwitz1895}.
%
Definitions of stability are ubiquitous in the literature; see, e.g.,
\cite{Khalil2002,Teschl2012,Vidyasagar1993}.

\section{Stability of Continuous Systems}

In order to understand the theory presented in this work, it is necessary to
understand not only the stability of hybrid systems but also the stability of
continuous systems and discrete systems which partly comprise hybrid systems.
%

\subsection{Stability about an Equilibrium Point}
This work is chiefly concerned with autonomous systems of the form
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:autsys}
  \dx = \xf\arx
\end{align}
where $f : \D \to \Rn$ is a locally Lipschitz vector field valid on some domain
$\D \subset \Rn$.
%
Without loss of generality, suppose that the system \eqref{eq:autsys} has an equilibrium point at the
origin;
%
in other words, $\xf\argbzero = \boldzero$.
%
\begin{definition}
  The equilibrium point $\x = \boldzero$ is stable if, for each $\epsilon > 0$,
  $\exists \delta > 0$ such that
  \begin{align*}
    \nxzero < \delta \Rightarrow \nxt < \epsilon \ \forall \ t
    \geq 0.
  \end{align*}
  The equilibrium point is unstable if it is not stable.
\end{definition}

In addition to the above definition, there are stricter forms of stability:
\begin{definition}
  The equilibrium point $\x = \boldzero$ is {\bf asymptotically stable} if it is
  stable and $\delta$ can be chosen such that
  \begin{align*}
    \nxzero < \delta \Rightarrow \lim_{t \to \infty} \x\argt = 0.
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

Further, an even stronger form of stability is of interest in this work:
\begin{definition}
  The equilibrium point $\x = \boldzero$ is {\bf exponentially stable} if there
  exist real constants $c, k, \lambda > 0$ such that
  \begin{align*}
    \nxt \leq k \nxtnaught e^{-\lambda (t - t_{0})} \ \forall \ \nxtnaught
    < c.
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}


\section{Stability of Discrete Systems}

In analogy to continuous systems, consider the autonomous system which satisfies
the difference equation
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:disc-sys}
  x_{k+1} = f(x_{k}).
\end{align}
where $f : \D \to \D$ is a locally Lipschitz vector field valid on some domain
$\D \subset \Rn$.
%
Without loss of generality, suppose that the system \eqref{eq:disc-sys} has an
equilibrium point at the origin;
%
in other words, $f\argbzero = \boldzero$.
%
\begin{definition}
  The equilibrium point $\x = \boldzero$ of \eqref{eq:disc-sys} is stable if, for each $\epsilon > 0$,
  $\exists \delta > 0$ such that
  \begin{align*}
    \nxkzero < \delta \Rightarrow \nxk < \epsilon \ \forall \ k
    \geq 0.
  \end{align*}
  The equilibrium point is unstable if it is not stable.
\end{definition}

In addition to the above definition, there are stricter forms of stability:
\begin{definition}
  The equilibrium point $\x = \boldzero$ of \eqref{eq:disc-sys} is {\bf asymptotically stable} if it is
  stable and $\delta$ can be chosen such that
  \begin{align*}
    \nxkzero < \delta \Rightarrow \lim_{k \to \infty} \xk = 0.
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

Further, an even stronger form of stability is of interest in this work:
\begin{definition}
  The equilibrium point $\x = \boldzero$ of \eqref{eq:disc-sys} is {\bf
    exponentially stable} if there exist real constants $\alpha, \beta, c> 0$
  such that, for all $\nxknaught < c$ and $k \geq k_{0}$,
  \begin{align*}
    \nxk \leq \beta \nxknaught^{\alpha}.
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}
