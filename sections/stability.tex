\chapter{\uppercase{Energy Shaping}}

This chapter discusses stability of hybrid systems. Because of the unique nature
of hybrid systems, analysis of stability requires special treatment which is
distinct from continuous-time systems and more closely parallels that of
discrete-time systems.

\section{Stability of Continuous Systems}

In order to understand the theory presented in this work, it is necessary to
understand not only the stability of hybrid systems but also the stability of
continuous systems which partly comprise hybrid systems.

Contemporary treatment of stability generally relies on results initially
presented in the doctoral work of Aleksandr Lyapunov in 1892 \cite{}.
