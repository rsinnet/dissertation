\section{Langrangian Formulation}

\section{Spatial Vector Algebra}
While a Lagrangian-based approach to modeling is useful for theoretical applications and smaller systems, its shortcomings quickly emerge as systems grow in complexity.
%
Perhaps more than anything else, this poor scalability stems from the need to successively multiply rotation matrices in symbolic form resulting in progressively larger expressions.
%
Moreover, as complexity grows, it becomes is increasingly difficult to glean any useful bit of intuition from examining the expressions in symbolic form.
