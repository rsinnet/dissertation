I would like to acknowledge my advisory committee for their thoughtful
suggestions while writing this dissertation.
%
I would like to thank my advisor, Aaron Ames, in particular for the tremendous
amount of insight he has provided over the years.
%
I would also like to acknowledge Jessy Grizzle and Christine Chevallereau for
their insight into hybrid systems and modeling.
%
In addition, the method of energy shaping is based in part on the ideas of Mark
Spong whose work laid the foundation for the theory presented herein.
%
Finally, I would like to thank the National Science Foundation for supporting my
research through much of my time as a graduate student through the Graduate
Research Fellowship Program.
