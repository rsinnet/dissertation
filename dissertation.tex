% Hyperref setup below.  You should be able to get away with using uncommenting just the first line.
% \usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}

% if \usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref} doesn't work try this.
% \usepackage{hyperref}  % Hidelinks is an option that removes link visiability.  TAMU Thesis Offices prefers to not see the links. But often doesn't work.  
% 
\hypersetup{
    colorlinks=true,
    linkcolor=black,
    citecolor=black,

    urlcolor=black,
}
%%%%%%%  End of hyperref setup.  One of these two options should work, but my motto with hyperref is when in doubt, comment it out!
%%%%%%%%%  This hopefully fixes the problem with vertical spacing of section headings at the top of the page..

% \preto\subsection{%
% \ifnum\value{subsection}=0\addtocontents{toc}{\vskip-6pt}\fi
